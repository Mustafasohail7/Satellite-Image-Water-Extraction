# Satellite Image Water Extraction

Created as the final project for CS-446: Applied Digital Image Processing at Habib University

* The project contains a MATLAB Application that demonstrates our algorithm
* The required inputs are '.TIFF' files of bands 2-7 of a satellite image which usually correspond to Red,Blue,Green,NIR,SWIR1 & SWIR2 respectively.
* The algorithm generates an image that has the entire water regions from the image extracted out and marked in blue. The rest of the image is color coded to yellow to exaggerate the effect.
* This algorithm is only tested for Landsat 8-9 Images provided by USGS.
